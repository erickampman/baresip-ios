The root directories of openssl, baresip-ios, and re-ios must be in the same directories for the below to work. 
I don't have specific info on how to build openssl for IOS. It wasn't difficult though.

# wipe it all out at once:
rm -rf build-ios-baresip build-ios-baresip-sim baresip.xcframework

rm -rf build-ios-baresip
cmake --preset ios-xcode
cmake --build --preset ios-xcode --config Release
find build-ios-baresip -name "libbaresip.a"


rm -rf build-ios-baresip-sim
cmake --preset ios-xcode-sim
cmake --build --preset ios-xcode-sim --config Release
lipo -info build-ios-baresip-sim/Release/Release/libbaresip.a

# xcframework:

xcodebuild -create-xcframework \
  -library build-ios-baresip/Release/Release/libbaresip.a \
  -headers include \
  -library build-ios-baresip-sim/Release/Release/libbaresip.a \
  -headers include \
  -output baresip.xcframework
